## 🧠 Tech Stack & Skills

I primarily work in **Visual Studio Code**, using **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for repository hosting. I rely on **NPM**, both to manage packages in my own projects and to publish open source libraries.

## 🚧 Projects

Here are the projects I’m currently working on:

- [NativeSass](https://github.com/nativesass/nativesass): A React Native library that lets you create StyleSheets with Sass- and CSS-like functionality, without losing the default experience of creating them the React Native way. Learn more at the <a href="https://nativesass.github.io">official docs website</a>.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

I’m planning to dive deeper into **C++** and **Java**. Their syntax feels familiar thanks to my experience with JavaScript and TypeScript, and I’m excited to explore their broader use cases and performance benefits.
